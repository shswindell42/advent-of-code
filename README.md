# Advent of Code Solutions
These are my solutions for the advent of code. I've enjoyed doing this the past few years, hope you give it a try as well!

I've tried to not rely on packages outside of what's offered by python out of the box. However, for 2025 day 10 part 2 I decided to use scipy milp, so I've added uv to manage dependencies.
